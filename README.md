<h1>Youtube to WordPress</h1>
<p>We are using Youtube API ( you will need api key) to collect new video from specific channels and add them to WordPress as post.</p>




<h2>What to change?</h2>
<p>You will have to open "skripta.php" and add your api key to $key on the second line.</p>

<h2>Channels</h2>
<p>You can see list of channels that I use in "kanali.txt" , you can change them and add channels that you want. </p>
